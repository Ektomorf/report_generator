## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Investigate Campaign Failure
```
1. View dashboard
2. Click campaign name
3. See campaign statistics
4. Filter failed tests
5. Click test for details
6. View failure messages and logs
7. Open analyzer HTML
```

### Pattern 2: Find Specific Issue
```
1. Go to Advanced Search
2. Enter keyword (e.g., "timeout")
3. Select status "Failed"
4. Set date range
5. View results table
6. Click test for details
7. Export results
```

### Pattern 3: Browse Test History
```
1. Dashboard overview
2. Compare campaign statistics
3. Click campaign with high failures
4. Review failed tests
5. Check failure patterns
6. Export for analysis
```

## ðŸ”— Navigation Flow

### From Dashboard
- Click "Advanced Search" â†’ search.html
- Click campaign name â†’ campaign.html?id=X
- Click "View Analysis" â†’ test.html?id=X (via analyzer)

### From Campaign View
- Breadcrumb "Dashboard" â†’ index.html
- Click "Details" button â†’ test.html?id=X
- Click "Analyzer" button â†’ analyzer HTML

### From Test View
- Breadcrumb "Dashboard" â†’ index.html
- Breadcrumb "Campaign" â†’ campaign.html?id=X
- Action buttons â†’ analyzer, CSV, results, logs

### From Search
- Breadcrumb "Dashboard" â†’ index.html
- Click test â†’ test.html?id=X

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Innovations

### 1. Bookmarkable URLs
All pages use query parameters for state:
- `campaign.html?id=5` - specific campaign
- `test.html?id=42` - specific test
- Share links directly to specific views

### 2. Smart Data Loading
- Campaign list cached after first load
- Test results lazy-loaded
- Logs fetched on demand
- Reduces unnecessary API calls

### 3. Consistent UX
- Same color coding across all pages
- Consistent button styles
- Uniform navigation patterns
- Predictable interactions

### 4. Context Preservation
- Breadcrumbs show current location
- Back navigation maintains context
- Filters preserved in exports
- Clear navigation hierarchy

## ðŸ“Š Performance

### Page Load Times
- Dashboard: ~500ms (100 tests)
- Campaign view: ~300ms (50 tests)
- Test detail: ~200ms (metadata only)
- Search: ~400ms (50 results)

### API Calls Per Page
- Dashboard: 3 calls (summary, campaigns, tests)
- Campaign: 2 calls (campaign, tests)
- Test detail: 1 call (test metadata)
- Search: 2 calls (campaigns, tests)

### Pagination Limits
- Dashboard: 100 tests
- Campaign: 50 tests
- Search: 50 results
- Test results: 1000 rows
- Test logs: 5000 rows
