# Testing the Fixed HTML Viewers

## Issue Fixed

The HTML viewers were showing empty tables because they tried to fetch CSV files via `fetch()`, which browsers block for local files (`file://` protocol).

## Solution Applied

✅ **Embedded CSV Data**: CSV data is now embedded directly in each HTML file
✅ **No External Dependencies**: HTML files are completely self-contained
✅ **Works Offline**: No need for a web server or internet connection

## Files Ready to Test

These files have been regenerated with embedded data and should work properly:

1. **`output\v1_1_tests_fwd_260925_150629\test_v1_1_fwd__test_fwd_defaults\test_fwd_defaults_viewer.html`**
   - Contains **26 columns** of rich test data
   - Includes peak detection data, frequency sweeps, and more

2. **`output\rtn_v1_1_default\test_v1_1_rtn__test_rtn_defaults\test_rtn_defaults_viewer.html`**
   - Contains **18 columns** of return path test data
   - Includes channel configurations, LO frequencies, switch connections

## How to Test

1. **Open any `*_viewer.html` file directly in your browser**
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Right-click → "Open with" → Browser

2. **You should immediately see:**
   - ✅ Data in the table (not empty!)
   - ✅ Row count in the status bar (e.g., "Showing 77 of 77 rows")
   - ✅ Working column controls on the left
   - ✅ Functional search box
   - ✅ Column preset buttons

3. **Test the Interactive Features:**
   - **Search**: Type "get_channel" to filter rows
   - **Column Presets**: Click "Basic", "Detailed", "Network", "All"
   - **Column Toggles**: Uncheck/check individual columns
   - **Scrolling**: Horizontal scroll to see all columns

## Generate All Updated Files

To regenerate all HTML files with embedded data:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the batch processor (force mode)
python batch_log_viewer.py output/ --force

# Option 2: Use the simple batch file
process_all_logs_force.bat
```

## Expected Results

- **Empty tables should be gone** - you'll see actual log data
- **All interactive features should work** without needing a web server
- **Files work completely offline** - no network requests
- **Fast loading** - data is already embedded

If you still see empty tables, please let me know which specific file you're testing!
