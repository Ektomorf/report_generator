## Enhanced Navigation

### Updated Dashboard (`index.html`)

**New Features**:
- Navigation bar with links to:
  - Dashboard (home)
  - Advanced Search
- Clickable campaign names (links to campaign detail view)
- All test cards link to test detail view

### Navigation Flow

```
Dashboard (index.html)

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Level Navigation

Users can:
- Browse all campaigns on dashboard
- Drill into specific campaign
- View individual test details
- Use advanced search for complex queries
- Navigate back with breadcrumbs

### 2. Data Presentation

**Dashboard**: High-level overview with test cards
**Campaign View**: List view of tests in campaign
**Test View**: Detailed information with expandable sections
**Search**: Table view with multi-criteria filtering

### 3. Export Capabilities

- Dashboard: Export all failures
- Campaign view: Export campaign tests
- Search: Export filtered search results

All exports via API with filters preserved

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Test detail view uses expandable sections:
- Initially shows metadata and summary
- Click "View Results" to load test results table
- Click "View Logs" to load log entries
- Reduces initial page load time
- User controls what data to fetch

---

## Usage Examples

2. See campaign with failures
3. Click campaign name → campaign detail page
4. Filter by "Failed Tests Only"
5. Click test → test detail page
6. View failure messages and logs
7. Click "Open Analyzer HTML" for full analysis

### Scenario 2: Find All Tests with Timeout

1. Navigate to Advanced Search
2. Enter "timeout" in keyword field
3. Select "Failed" status
4. Click Search
5. View results table
6. Click test for details
7. Export results to CSV

### Scenario 3: Compare Campaign Results

1. Dashboard shows multiple campaigns

---

## Responsive Design

All pages include:
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Responsive grids
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Readable fonts on small screens
- Collapsible sections for narrow viewports

**Breakpoint**: 768px

**Mobile Optimizations**:
- Single-column layouts
- Stacked action buttons
- Simplified tables
- Larger touch targets

---

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading
- Test results not loaded until requested
- Logs fetched on demand
- Failure messages loaded per-test

### Pagination
- Dashboard: 100 tests per page
- Campaign view: 50 tests per page
- Search results: 50 results per page
- Test results: 1000 rows per page
- Test logs: 5000 rows per page

### Caching
- Campaign list cached after first load
- Previous page results cached in browser
- API responses cacheable by browser

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Edge 90+
- Safari 14+

**Requirements**:
- ES6 JavaScript (async/await, arrow functions)
- Fetch API
- URLSearchParams
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

---

## Development

### Adding New Pages

1. Create `newpage.html` in `web/` directory
2. Create `newpage.js` for logic
3. Add styles to `advanced.css`
4. Link from dashboard or other pages
5. Update navigation breadcrumbs

### Adding New Features

Follow established patterns:
- Use `apiCall()` function for API requests
- Implement `showLoading()` and `showError()`
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Include breadcrumb navigation
- Make URLs bookmarkable

---

## Troubleshooting

### Links not working

**Check**: API server running on port 8000
**Solution**: Start API with `python api_server.py`

### Campaign page shows 404

**Check**: Campaign ID in URL
**Solution**: Verify campaign exists in database

### Test details not loading

**Check**: Test ID is valid
**Check**: API endpoint `/api/tests/{id}` works
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors

### Search returns no results

**Check**: Database has matching data
**Check**: Date range not too narrow
**Solution**: Try broader search criteria

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential additions:
- Analytics dashboard with charts
- Test comparison (side-by-side)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Saved searches/favorites
- Test history across campaigns
- Comment/notes on tests
- Dark mode toggle

See Phase 5 and 6 in `SQL_IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md` for more ideas.
